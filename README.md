## Course Overview

This course covers both the theoretical and practical aspects of data mining and machine learning. Topics include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), supervised and unsupervised learning, model evaluation, and the basics of deep learning. The course is designed to equip you with the skills to apply these techniques to real-world datasets.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Understand core data mining processes and machine learning frameworks.
- Perform data cleaning, transformation, and visualization using Python.
- Build and evaluate predictive models using algorithms like regression, decision trees, SVMs, and neural networks.
- Apply both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to solve practical problems.
- Effectively communicate your findings through data visualizations and reports.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:

- Basic programming skills (preferably in Python)
- An understanding of fundamental statistics and linear algebra
- A keen interest in data analysis and machine learning
